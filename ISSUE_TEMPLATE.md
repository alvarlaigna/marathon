## Head over to JIRA!

Please note that we use JIRA for issue tracking and only keep GitHub issues around to not break existing links. Please prefer filing issues [directly in JIRA](https://jira.mesosphere.com/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa?pid=10401).

You can sign in to JIRA using github or google as identity providers.
